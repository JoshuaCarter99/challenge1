# <Horiseon>

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was a driving interest in how one could clean up the HTML/CSS code within a webpage WITHOUT ruining the integrity of the established webpage.
- I built this project to obtain experience in something I was not entirely familiar with doing and learn new concepts in the process.
- The problem solved within the challenge was not one of creating new features nor a new webpage, but editing and adding additional code to a webpage that had unorganized and non-semantic code.
- I learned how to avoid using "div" AND learned how to replace the placeholder "div" with more efficient semantic tags. I also learned how to organize given attributes in CSS to avoid longer and more drawn out sequences of script. Lastly, I learned the value of applying alt attributes to a given "img" and creating a more concise title to a "title element."

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Organized CSS script by combining class sections that had identical properties.
3. Organized HTML script by replacing "div" with proper semantics, putting semantics in sequential order to keep integrity of webpage's design, renamed title element with more concise title, and adding alt attributes to all "img" links.
4. Pushed local changes back to main branch on original GitHub repository (via GitHub.com), and deployed code at live URL.
